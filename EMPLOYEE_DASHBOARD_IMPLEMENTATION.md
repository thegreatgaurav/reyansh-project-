# Employee Dashboard - Role-Based Access Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Features Implemented:

#### 1. **Header Profile Dropdown Menu**
- **All users** now see either "Employee Dashboard" or "My Dashboard" in their profile dropdown
- **CEO / HR Manager**: Shows "Employee Dashboard"
- **All other roles**: Shows "My Dashboard"

#### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**

##### CEO / HR Manager:
- ✅ Can see ALL employees
- ✅ Can search, filter, and sort employees
- ✅ Can add new employees
- ✅ Can edit any employee
- ✅ Can delete employees
- ✅ Full management controls visible

##### Other Employees (CRM, Sales Executive, Store Manager, etc.):
- ✅ Can ONLY see their own employee profile
- ✅ Cannot see other employees
- ✅ Cannot edit their own profile (view-only)
- ✅ Cannot add or delete employees
- ✅ Search/filter controls are hidden
- ✅ Can view their own:
  - Profile information
  - Tasks
  - Performance metrics
  - Attendance records
  - Notifications

#### 3. **Email Matching - Works with Both Mock and Real Logins**

The system uses **intelligent matching** that works with:

##### Mock Logins:
- Email format: `mock.customer relations manager@reyanshelectronics.com`
- Matches employees by:
  1. **Role keywords** in Designation field (e.g., "Customer Relations Manager")
  2. **Role keywords** in Department field
  3. **Email partial match**

##### Real Logins:
- Email format: `amit.sharma@reyanshelectronics.com`
- Matches employees by:
  1. **Exact email match**
  2. **Partial email match** (email prefix)

### How It Works:

1. **User logs in** (mock or real)
2. **System checks user role**:
   - If CEO/HR Manager → Full access to all employees
   - If other role → Restricted to own profile only
3. **Profile dropdown** shows appropriate label:
   - CEO/HR Manager → "Employee Dashboard"
   - Others → "My Dashboard"
4. **Employee matching**:
   - For mock users: Matches by role keywords in Designation/Department
   - For real users: Matches by exact email
5. **Dashboard loads** with appropriate permissions

### Employee Sheet Setup:

To ensure the system works correctly, your Google Sheet "Employees" should have these employees:

| Role | EmployeeCode | Email | Designation |
|------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| CEO | EMP001 | rajesh.kumar@reyanshelectronics.com | CEO |
| CRM | EMP002 | amit.sharma@reyanshelectronics.com | Customer Relations Manager |
| HR Manager | EMP003 | vikram.singh@reyanshelectronics.com | HR Manager |
| Store Manager | EMP004 | suresh.patel@reyanshelectronics.com | Store Manager |
| Sales Executive | EMP005 | rahul.mehta@reyanshelectronics.com | Sales Executive |
| Process Coordinator | EMP006 | deepak.verma@reyanshelectronics.com | Process Coordinator |

### Testing:

#### Test as CEO (Mock Login):
1. Login with role: "CEO"
2. Check profile dropdown → Should see "Employee Dashboard"
3. Click "Employee Dashboard" → Should see all employees
4. Should be able to add/edit/delete employees

#### Test as CRM (Mock Login):
1. Login with role: "Customer Relations Manager"
2. Check profile dropdown → Should see "My Dashboard"
3. Click "My Dashboard" → Should see only CRM employee (Amit Sharma)
4. Should NOT see edit/delete buttons
5. Should NOT see search/filter controls

#### Test as Real User:
1. Login with actual Google account (e.g., amit.sharma@reyanshelectronics.com)
2. System matches email to employee record
3. Shows appropriate dashboard based on role

### Files Modified:

1. **src/components/common/Header.js**
   - Added "Employee Dashboard" / "My Dashboard" menu item to profile dropdown
   - Shows different text based on user role

2. **src/components/employeeDashboard/AdvancedEmployeeDashboard.js**
   - Implemented role-based filtering
   - Added intelligent email/role matching for mock and real logins
   - Hide controls for non-CEO users
   - Restrict edit/delete permissions

3. **src/components/employeeDashboard/EmployeeCard.js**
   - Made Edit and Delete menu items conditional
   - Only shown when user has permission

### Console Debugging:

The system logs helpful information in browser console:
- Current user email being searched
- User role
- Available employees
- Which employee was matched (or why match failed)

Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs when testing.

### Production Deployment:

When deploying to production, you can remove the mock login functionality by:
1. Removing mock login code from `authService.js`
2. All matching will use real Google emails only

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The employee dashboard is now fully functional with role-based access control for both mock and real logins!
